By popular request I have changed the scoring this year, it is 2 points for an exact score and 1 for a correct outcome. Check your scores and make sure you're happy. Just for this week since I was slow off the mark I have given predictors who for admin reasons on my end didn't recieve usernames till late the same score as me to start them off. Happy predicting!",
